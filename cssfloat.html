            Matsum. & Nakai var. lanatus), citron melons (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (L. H. Bailey) Mansf.), and the
            edible var. vulgaris may be the most important. This taxonomy originated with the erroneous synonymization of
            the wooly melon Citrullus lanatus with the sweet watermelon Citrullus vulgaris by L.H. Bailey in 1930.[9]
            Molecular data including sequences from the original collection of Thunberg and other relevant type material,
            show that the sweet watermelon (Citrullus vulgaris Schrad.) and the bitter wooly melon Citrullus lanatus
            (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai are not closely related to each other.[10] A proposal to conserve the name, Citrullus
            lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai, was accepted by the nomenclature committee and confirmed at the International
            Botanical Congress in 2017.The species is further divided into several varieties, of which bitter wooly melon
